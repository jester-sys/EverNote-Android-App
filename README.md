Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates the concerns of data management, UI rendering, and user interactions.

    Model: Represents the data and business logic of the app. It includes classes such as Note, NoteRepository, and DatabaseHelper responsible for handling CRUD operations on notes and managing the underlying data source.
    View: Displays the user interface and handles user interactions. It includes activities, fragments, and layout files responsible for rendering the note list, note details, and input forms.
    ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It exposes data to the View, handles user actions, and updates the Model accordingly. The ViewModel also abstracts the business logic, allowing for better testability and separation of concerns.

Usage

    Launch the app and create a new account or log in with your existing credentials.
    To create a new note, click on the "+" button and provide a title and content for the note.
